SQL Shortcut Using AI
Working with SQL can be time-consuming, but I found an effective shortcut using AI that significantly speeds up the process. Here’s how I did it:

Extracting the ERD with DbVisualizer

First, download and install DbVisualizer.
Use DbVisualizer to extract the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for your Rockbuster database.
Using the ERD with ChatGPT

Add the ERD image to ChatGPT so it understands the connections between tables.
Provide ChatGPT with commands to write SQL queries based on the ERD.
This method allows me to generate SQL queries in minutes, ensuring that the outcomes are accurate. It’s a significant time-saver compared to traditional methods.
